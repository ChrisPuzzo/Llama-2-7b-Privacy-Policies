# <a name="_ml0o4xjz9eb3"></a>AI-System Overview
For this project, we applied a fine-tuning technique to a large language model (LLM) which is a type of deep learning model. Our fine-tuning efforts aimed to improve the inferences generated by the LLM for the specific knowledge domain of privacy policies.

LLMs are useful for natural language processing and text prediction and may be trained with a large amount of general-purpose knowledge from Internet sources. However, in many cases, these models are not trained well enough to answer questions or draw on knowledge from specific domains. To address this gap, the process of fine-tuning is used to augment or incorporate specific domain knowledge into the LLM.

It's useful to fine-tune an existing LLM versus simply retraining a model from the ground up because training an LLM is costly and time-consuming. It can cost millions to hundreds of millions of dollars to train a large transformer model. The fine-tuning approach leverages the sunk cost and time spent training a general-purpose LLM, and potentially provides the benefit of narrow domain expertise for a specialty purpose.

The base LLM model used was Meta’s Llama 2 (Meta AI, 2023) available through Hugging Face from NousResearch (nousresearch, 2023). We selected this version of Llama 2 because it is specifically tailored for use with the Hugging Face Transformers Library (Wolf et al. 2020). Another reason for selecting Llama 2 is that it is open-source and has a license that allows free use for research purposes.

We wanted to use the question-answering ability of Llama 2 to allow us to answer questions and summarize text contained in the privacy policies that govern our use of Internet services. Many of these policies are written in very technical and complicated words and can be difficult for people to understand. Using the power of AI we believed that we could create a model that can easily read and analyze these complicated documents to assist people in understanding them.

We also wanted to be able to fine-tune the model using techniques that did not require the use of a supercomputer. That is how we discovered Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) (Mangrulkar et al., 2022). Hugging Face puts out PEFT and QLoRA to be able to train transformers such as Llama on consumer-grade hardware. It is also the only way something like Llama could be trained on the free tier of Colab.

To accomplish this task we found a dataset of the privacy policies from over 100 different companies on Hugging Face (sjsq, 2024). While there is no information about the account that gathered the data nor any metadata about how it was gathered, we inspected the data before using it and confirmed that it contains relevant data and nothing concerning like PII.  It’s a CSV file containing 1789 records that represent privacy policy text strings from 50 unique companies’ privacy policies.
# <a name="_eei11dt5ozxn"></a>Relevant Theoretical Background
There are a couple of important areas of content knowledge needed to understand how our model functions. Firstly, a basic understanding of Neural AI, particularly deep learning is important. All the systems we are using are built to be used with neural networks and require some knowledge of them to use. For example, Llama is an LLM, meaning that it is a deep-learning network. The 7b means that it has 7 billion parameters in it, which makes it, as the name suggests, very large. This is the smallest Llama 2 available, with there also being a 13 and 70 billion parameter version. 

Understanding how large these models are is important in understanding why techniques like PEFT and QLoRA are needed. PEFT differs from standard fine-tuning in that instead of tuning all the parameters of a model, it only tunes "a small number of (extra) model parameters instead of all the model's parameters' (Mangrulkar et al., 2022). It can tune a model using a much smaller set of data to get results that, while not perfect, are good enough for the majority of use cases out there (such as ours). QLoRA is important because it allows us to fine-tune these models on much smaller devices. Without QLoRA fine-tuning Llama 2 would probably not be possible with our given resources.

Also an understanding of what Transformers and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is important to our project as the model we are using Llama is a Transformer that is used for NLP. Particularly question and answering NLP is being used in this task. Transformers are Neural Networks that abandon the use of C-RNNs in favor of using solely an attention model(Vaswane et al., 2017). This has led to great leaps forward in the field of neural AI.

All these technologies described above are used in our project. Here we have only gone into a concise summary of them, for further reading refer to the references at the bottom of this paper.

# <a name="_k8m0ippyji50"></a>AI System Development and Evaluation
The system was partially developed using open-source software and partially developed on our own. To start we found a Colab module on tuning Llama 2 on Hugging Face (. It sets up the PEFT and QLoRA variables for us, allowing us to focus more on the results than the setup. In addition, we had some problems in the fine-tuning when building our code for PEFT with Llama 2, and switching to an open-source program solved those issues. In addition to this, we needed to find a way to test the model to figure out how well it performed. 

To accomplish this task, we built out two Python codes. One to prompt the fine-tuned model and one to prompt the pre-fine-tuned Llama 2 model. By uploading our fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub, we were able to easily access it whenever it was needed from different environments. So we developed a Jupyter Notebook that could take in any transformer model and load it into Colab. The notebook takes that model and allows the user to prompt it. It also saves a list of the responses to allow for further analysis, such as calculating an F1 score.

The biggest problem we ran into was Colab limits. Unfortunately, Colab would only let you query the model a couple of times before it used up all the VRam available on the system. To get around this we bought a month of Colab-Pro.

### <a name="_60xljgh8otuc"></a>Evaluation
To evaluate the fine-tuned Llama2 LLM, we developed a list of 12 questions about privacy policies to use as prompts (see Appendix A). In addition to these questions, we selected a relatively small privacy policy to use as context for the questions. Initially, we attempted to use the privacy policy from Starbucks (https://www.starbucks.com/terms/privacy-policy/), but found that this was too much content to include in our prompts. Instead, we selected a relatively small privacy policy posted by a startup called TopHive (<https://tophive.ai/privacy-policy>). Note that this company’s privacy policy is not represented in the dataset used for fine-tuning.

Each of the 12 selected test questions were combined with the TopHive privacy policy text to form the prompts. Each of the prompts was processed against both the base Llama2-7B model and the fine-tuned Llama2-7B model. The responses from these tests were captured and stored for comparison. The responses can be found in Appendix C.

Next, we attempted to calculate ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores for each of the test results. ROUGE is a set of metrics designed to evaluate text summarization output and automated text translations. To calculate ROUGE scores, we used the rouge-score library (https://pypi.org/project/rouge-score/).

\*Note: We misapplied the ROUGE algorithm and this piece of work needs to be reprocessed using ideal answer reference strings generated by a human. This work is forthcoming.
### <a name="_rcte39m23lbv"></a>Findings
Based on our own subjective evaluation, we find that the query responses from the fine-tuned Llama2-7b model are an improvement over the baseline model results.

All of the responses are included in Appendix C for reference, but here’s one example:


|q2|prompt = "Does this policy address data sharing with third parties: " + policy|
| :- | :- |
|a2.untuned|<p>Yes, this policy addresses data sharing with third parties. Here are the relevant details:</p><p></p><p>\* "We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security." This suggests that TopHive will take appropriate measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p><p>\* "Information collected automatically is used only to identify users for marketing activities." This implies that TopHive may share your personal data with third-party marketing partners or use it for marketing purposes itself, but it does not provide any details on how or to whom this data will be shared.</p><p>\* "You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features." This suggests that TopHive may share your personal data with third parties if you choose not to provide it, but it does not provide any details on which features will be unavailable.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while the policy does address data sharing with third parties, it does not provide much detail on how or to whom this data will be shared, which may be a concern for some users. It is recommended that users who are uncertain about how their data will be used or shared contact TopHive directly for more information.</p>|
|a2.tuned|Yes, this policy addresses data sharing with third parties. According to the policy, TopHive may share your personal data with third parties for marketing activities. |

Note how the answer provided by the fine-tuned model was accurate and more succinct than the untuned model’s response. The untuned model’s response was essentially a large block of quoted text from the privacy policy. Similar results can be seen in many of the other questions although not all of them.
