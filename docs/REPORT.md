# AI-System Overview

For this project, we applied a fine-tuning technique to a large language
model (LLM) which is a type of deep learning model. Our fine-tuning
efforts aimed to improve the inferences generated by the LLM for the
specific knowledge domain of privacy policies.

LLMs are useful for natural language processing (NLP) and text
prediction, and may be trained with a large amount of general-purpose
knowledge from Internet sources. However, in many cases, these models
are not trained well enough to answer questions or draw on knowledge
from specific domains. To address this gap, the process of fine-tuning
is used to augment or incorporate specific domain knowledge into the
LLM.

It's useful to fine-tune an existing LLM versus simply retraining a
model from the ground up because training an LLM is costly and
time-consuming. It can cost millions to hundreds of millions of dollars
to train a large transformer model. The fine-tuning approach leverages
the cost and time spent training a general-purpose LLM, and potentially
provides the benefit of narrow domain expertise for a specialty purpose.

The base LLM model used was Meta’s Llama 2 7 billion parameter model
(Meta AI, 2023) available through Hugging Face from NousResearch
(nousresearch, 2023). We selected this version of Llama 2 because it is
specifically tailored for use with the Hugging Face Transformers Library
(Wolf et al. 2020). Another reason for selecting Llama 2 is that it is
open-source and has a license that allows free use for research
purposes.

We wanted to use the question-answering ability of Llama 2 to allow us
to answer questions and summarize text contained in the privacy policies
that govern our use of Internet services. Many of these policies are
written with technical jargon, which may have legal implications, and
can be difficult for people to understand. Using the power of AI we
believed that we could create a model that can easily read and analyze
these complicated documents to assist people in understanding them.

We also wanted to be able to fine-tune the model using techniques that
did not require the use of a supercomputer. That is how we discovered
Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) (Mangrulkar et al., 2022). Hugging Face provides PEFT and QLoRA
for training transformers such as Llama on consumer-grade hardware. This
is also the only way an LLM like Llama could be trained on Colab for
free or without significant expense.

To accomplish this task we found a dataset containing the privacy
policies from over 50 different companies on Hugging Face (sjsq, 2024).
While there is no information about the account that gathered the data
nor any metadata about how it was gathered, we inspected the data before
using it and confirmed that it contains relevant data and nothing
concerning like PII. It’s a CSV file containing 1789 records that
represent privacy policy text strings from 50 unique companies’ privacy
policies.

# Relevant Theoretical Background

To understand how our model works, it’s important to first have a basic
understanding of neural AI and Deep Learning. All of the systems and
libraries that we are using are designed to be used with neural networks
and require some knowledge of them to make use of them. For example,
Llama is an LLM, meaning that it is a deep-learning network. The 7b
means that it has 7 billion parameters in it, which makes it, as the
name suggests, very large. Note that this is the smallest Llama 2 model
available, and there are also 13 billion and 70 billion parameter models
available.

Understanding how large these models are is important for understanding
why techniques like PEFT and QLoRA are useful. PEFT differs from
standard fine-tuning in that instead of tuning all the parameters of a
model, it’s used to tune "a small number of (extra) model parameters
instead of all the model's parameters” (Mangrulkar et al., 2022). It can
tune a model using a much smaller set of data to get results that, while
not perfect, are good enough for the majority of use cases out there
(such as ours). QLoRA is important because it allows us to fine-tune the
model on much smaller, less powerful devices. Without QLoRA fine-tuning
Llama 2 would probably not be possible with our given resources.

An understanding of AI Transformers and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is also important to our project, as the Llama model we are using
is a Transformer that is used for NLP. In particular, we are using the
NLP capabilities of the model for question and answer and text
summarization tasks. Transformers are Neural Networks that abandon the
use of C-RNNs in favor of using solely an attention model (Vaswane et
al., 2017). This has led to great leaps forward in the field of neural
AI.

This is a concise summary of the technologies used in our project. For
further reading, refer to the References for detailed sources.

# AI System Development and Evaluation

The system was partially developed using open-source software and
partially developed on our own. To start we found a Colab module on
tuning Llama 2 on Hugging Face.co. It sets up the PEFT and QLoRA
variables, allowing us to focus on the results rather than the setup. In
addition, we had some problems in the fine-tuning when building our code
for PEFT with Llama 2, and switching to an open-source program solved
those issues. Additionally, we needed to find a way to test the model to
figure out how well it performed.

To accomplish this task, we instantiated versions of our Python code.
One to prompt the fine-tuned model and one to prompt the stock Llama 2
model. By uploading our fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub, we
were able to easily access it whenever it was needed from different
environments.

Ee developed a Jupyter Notebook that could use any specified transformer
model, and load it into Google Colab. The notebook takes the model, and
allows the user to prompt it. It also saves a list of the responses to
allow for further analysis, such as calculating an F1 score.

The biggest problem we encountered was with Colab usage limitations.
Unfortunately, Colab would only let us query the model a handful of
times before it used up all the VRam available on the system. To get
around this and expedite the process, we purchased a month of Colab-Pro
service.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the fine-tuned Llama2-7b LLM, we developed a list of 12
questions about privacy policies to use as prompts (see Appendix A). In
addition to these questions, we selected a relatively small privacy
policy to use as context for the questions. Initially, we attempted to
use the privacy policy from a well known company (Starbucks
(https://www.starbucks.com/terms/privacy-policy/), but found that this
was too much content to include in our prompts. To solve this problem,
we selected a relatively small privacy policy posted by a startup called
TopHive
([<u>https://tophive.ai/privacy-policy</u>](https://tophive.ai/privacy-policy)).
Note that this company’s privacy policy is not represented in the
dataset used for fine-tuning.

Each of our 12 test questions were combined with the TopHive privacy
policy text to form prompts. Each of the prompts was processed against
three LLMs: the base Llama2-7B model, the fine-tuned Llama2-7B model,
and ChatGPT4. The responses from the LLMs for each of these tests were
captured and stored for evaluation. The full list of responses received
from each of the LLMs is included in Appendix C.

We used responses from ChatGPT4 to form a baseline of comparison for
each of the other two models.

We developed a Python program to calculate ROUGE (Recall-Oriented
Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores for each of the test prompt
responses. ROUGE is a set of metrics designed to evaluate text
summarization output and automated text translations. To calculate ROUGE
scores, we used the rouge-score library
(https://pypi.org/project/rouge-score/).

The detailed results of our testing is included in Appendix B.

### Findings

Ultimately we achieved what we set out to do which was to fine tune a
Llama2-7b LLM model using QLoRA and PEFT techniques with a privacy
policy dataset. Unfortunately, the resulting fine-tuned model did not
provide improvements over the baseline Llama2 model.

The ROUGE scores show that there was a minimal improvement in a couple
of test questions, but generally the results regressed when we
fine-tuned the Llama 2 model.

The untuned Llama 2 model performed well, but also exhibited issues. For
example, see question 2 below where it confidently asserts that data
sharing with third parties is addressed in the TopHive privacy policy.
Both the untuned and tuned models responded in the affirmative to this
questions, when in fact, the policy DOES NOT address data sharing with
third parties.

All of the responses are included in Appendix C for reference, but
here’s one example:

<p>* "Information collected automatically is used only to identify users

any details on which features will be unavailable.</p>

that users who are uncertain about how their data will be used or shared
contact TopHive directly for more information.</p></th>

Ultimately, the fine-tuning that we did was not useful for someone
wishing to evaluate a privacy policy document. This could be due to
numerous factors some of which could include:

1.  The dataset used for fine-tuning was not adequate in size.

2.  The dataset used for fine-tuning was not adequate in quality of
    > content or structure.

3.  The benchmark responses from ChatGPT4 could be improved by humans.

4.  The prompts used for testing could be improved.

5.  The 7B parameter model may be too small for this task.

6.  The ROUGE metric may not adequately measure the quality of
    > responses.

<th>Llama2.untuned</th>
<th><p>Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the

<p>1. More detailed explanation of the types of data collected: While
the policy mentions that Device Information is collected, it would be
helpful to provide more detail on what specifically is collected (e.g.
IP address, browser type, time zone). Additionally, it would be helpful
to provide more information on the types of personal data collected
(e.g. name, email address, company).</p>

the collected data is used only to identify users for marketing
activities, but it would be helpful to provide more detail on how this
is done (e.g. what types of marketing activities, how the data is
analyzed).</p>
<p>3. More information on data sharing: The policy mentions that data

more detail on what types of third parties (e.g. advertisers, analytics
providers) and why this data is shared.</p>
<p>4. Clarification on data retention: The policy states that data is

more detail on how long this is typically, and what criteria are used to
determine when data is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>5. More information on data security measures: While the policy
mentions that data is confidential and secure, it would be helpful to
provide more detail on the specific security measures in place to
protect data (e.g. encryption, access controls).</p>
<p>6. A clear and conspicuous link to the privacy policy: It would be
helpful to provide a clear and conspicuous link to the privacy policy on
the website's homepage and throughout the site.</p>
<p>7. A privacy dashboard: Consider creating a privacy dashboard where
users can easily access and manage their personal data, and where they
can easily find answers to common privacy questions.</p>
<p>8. A clear and simple explanation of data subject rights: Make sure
to inform users of their rights, such as the right to access, correct,
or delete their personal data, and how they can exercise these
rights.</p>
<p>9. A clear and simple explanation of the legal basis for data
processing: Make sure to inform users of the legal basis for processing
their personal data, and how this basis is related to the purpose of the
data processing.</p>
<p>10. A clear and simple explanation of the data controller's contact
information: Make sure to provide the data controller's contact
information, such as an email address or phone number, where users can

<th><p>Thank you for sharing your feedback on the TopHive website's
privacy policy. Here are some suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>1. Add a clear and concise summary of the policy: It would be helpful
to have a brief summary of the policy at the top of the page, so that
users can quickly understand what information is being collected and
why.</p>
<p>2. Use simpler language: The policy uses technical terms and jargon
that may be difficult for some users to understand. Consider using
simpler language and providing explanations for technical terms.</p>
<p>3. Provide more information about the types of data collected: While
the policy mentions that TopHive collects "Device Information," it would
be helpful to provide more information about the types of data that are
collected, such as IP addresses, browser types, and device types.</p>
<p>4. Explain how data is used: While the policy mentions that data is
used only to identify users for marketing activities, it would be
helpful to provide more information about how data is used, such as how
it is analyzed and how it is shared with third parties.</p>
<p>5. Provide more information about the security measures in place:
While the policy mentions that TopHive takes care of personal data and
undertakes to guarantee its confidentiality and security, it would be
helpful to provide more information about the security measures in
place, such as encryption and access controls.</p>
<p>6. Provide a way for users to access and correct their personal data:
It would be helpful to provide a way for users to access and correct
their personal data, such as a "My Account" feature.</p>
<p>7. Provide a way for users to opt-out of data collection: While the
policy mentions that users can choose not to provide personal data, it
would be helpful to provide a way for users to opt-out of data
collection altogether.</p>
<p>8. Provide more information about third-party data sharing: While the
policy mentions that TopHive may share data with third parties, it would
be helpful to provide more information about the types of third parties
with which data is shared and how the data is used by those third
parties.</p>
<p>9. Provide more information about the retention period of personal
data: While the policy mentions that personal data is retained for as
long as necessary, it would be helpful to provide more information about
the retention period of personal data and how it is determined.</p>
<p>10. Provide more information about the rights of users: While the
policy mentions that users have certain rights, such as the right to
access and correct their personal data, it would be helpful to provide
more information about those rights and how they can be exercised.</p>
<p>I hope these suggestions are helpful in improving the privacy policy
of TopHive.</p>
<p>Here's a revised version of the policy that enhances clarity,
structure, and compliance considerations:</p>
